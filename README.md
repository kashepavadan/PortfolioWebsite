# Portfolio Website
My personal website, featuring my detailed work history and descriptions of my software projects. The site includes dApps that can be interacted with if MetaMask is connected to the project page (enabled by ethers.js).

Currently live at [daniel.kashepava.com](http://daniel.kashepava.com/).
